  <Description>k__BackingField: "Life Potion is a magical concoction of a bright
    red that seems to radiate life and power. Its bottle seems to contain all the
    fiery energy of the fire itself. When you hold it, you can feel a comforting
    warmth emanating from its walls, as if the power of regeneration was burning
    inside.\r\n\r\nWhen she comes into contact with a Pok\xE9mon, even in a state
    of extreme distress or having succumbed to combat, her healing energy instantly
    diffuses through her body, reviving every fiber of her being. Wounds close instantly,
    tired limbs regain strength, and Pok\xE9mon vitality is restored to its maximum.\r\n"
