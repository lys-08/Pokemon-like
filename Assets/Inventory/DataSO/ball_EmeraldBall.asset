  <Description>k__BackingField: 'Emerald Ball was created in the depths of a cave
    where the nature surrounding it is lush. Its smooth surface, bright emerald green,
    evokes the splendor of green forests and exotic jungles. Each gradient of green
    that adorns its perfect sphere seems to capture sunlight, creating shimmering
    reflections like rays passing through the leaves.

    

    It increases the
    capture capacity if the pokemon is Emerald type'
